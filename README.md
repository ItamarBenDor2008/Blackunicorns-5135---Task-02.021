# Blackunicorns-5135---Task-05.05

## The task



## Getting Started

Write a function that receives an integer (int) and the same function will return an array with all the initial numbers up to the same total number (doesn't matter with ascending or descending order).

for example:
For the entry: 32

The function will return: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]

important comments:
 - A prime number is a number that is not divisible by any number other than one or itself
 - One is not considered a prime number
 - A helper function that does a small action can be used to help us solve the big problem.
